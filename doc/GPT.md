# GPT (GUID Partition Table)

It's a modern partitioning scheme for storage devices that replaces the older [[MBR (Master Boot Record)]] system.

## Key characteristics:

* More partitions: Supports up to 128 partitions (vs. MBR's 4 primary partitions)
* Larger disks: Can handle disks larger than 2TB (MBR limit)
* Redundancy: Stores partition data at both the beginning and end of the disk for recovery
* UEFI required: Modern UEFI firmware uses GPT (though some BIOS systems support it too)
* Unique IDs: Each partition gets a globally unique identifier (GUID)
* In your disk-config.nix:

## When using [[Disko]]:

```nix
# disk-config.nix

content = {
  type = "gpt";  # <-- This line specifies GPT partitioning
  partitions = {
    # ...
  };
};
```

This tells disko to create a GPT partition table on your disk before creating the individual partitions ([[ESP boot partition]] and [[root partition]]).

## Partition type codes:

* "EF00" = [[EFI System Partition (ESP)]] - required for [[UEFI boot]]
* Other common types: "8300" (Linux filesystem), "8200" (Linux swap)

For NixOS on modern hardware with UEFI, GPT is the correct and recommended choice.
